## Mocha 
is the main testing framework in this test suite. It provides functions to execute tests and handle logging test results to the terminal.

## Chai 
is an assertion library commonly used with Mocha.  
We use assertions to verify that the component that is being tested returns the value itâ€™s expected to return for a particular test case.

functions like it and describe are a part of Mocha. 
Assertions we make inside these functions, like expect(isSuccess).to.be.true, come from the Chai library.
